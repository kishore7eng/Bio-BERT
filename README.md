# Debiasing methods for Entity Detection in bio-medical domain

Entity detection is a task of identifying entities and
labelling them. Majority of the existing models perform well on entities seen during
training but are unable to generalize well on unseen novel entities. Our work focuses
on removing such bias from models in biomedical domain. Currently there aren’t
many debiased methods specific to entity detection task. We utilized the debiasing
methods which are used in different tasks and created our own baselines. We proposed
a new method for debiasing and experimented them on 3 datasets. Our debiased
models achieve significant gains over baseline models.

To study more about the existing models, Pleas have a look at following research papers.
